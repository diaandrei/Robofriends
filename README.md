# robofriends

The app illustrates how state management is done using Redux. To get robot images and info I used JSONPlacholder and RoboHash APIs. You can search through the robot names by typing into the search field.

To run the project:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
